# Ansible first experience

My first time working with Ansible, installing a php server and database on three 'servers' (which are actually docker instances, but the concept remains the same).

NOTE: This is a learning-oriented repo. Probably nothing for you to see. If you're interested still, read script.sh and ansible/commands.txt to maybe undertstand what I did. Also, of course you need to have ansible installed.
